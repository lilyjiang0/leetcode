/* array
There is a hidden integer array arr that consists of n non-negative integers.
It was encoded into another integer array encoded of length n - 1, such that encoded[i] = arr[i] 
XOR arr[i + 1]. For example, if arr = [1,0,2,1], then encoded = [1,2,3].
You are given the encoded array. You are also given an integer first, that is the first element 
of arr, i.e. arr[0].
Return the original array arr. It can be proved that the answer exists and is unique.

Constraints:
- 2 <= n <= 104
- encoded.length == n - 1
- 0 <= encoded[i] <= 105
- 0 <= first <= 105

Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(n)

Test: 
- min/max size encoded, 1/ 103.
- Encoded has integers which value = 0, value = 105.
- All integers are equal in Encoded.
- First has the value of 0 or 105.
- There is a huge difference between value of encoded and first, e.g. encoded = [100, 56, 20, 99], 
and first = 1.
