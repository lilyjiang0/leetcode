## Complexity
### Time complexity 
is the time taken by the algorithm to execute each set of instructions. It is always better to select the most efficient algorithm when a simple problem can solve with different methods.

### Space complexity 
is usually referred to as the amount of memory consumed by the algorithm. It is composed of two different spaces; Auxiliary space and Input space.
